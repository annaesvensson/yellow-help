## How to work with us

* Imagine what the user wants to do and what would make their life easier.
* Ask yourself, do I need this, do I want this, can I make this better?
* Have a look at files, folders, tools and the API for developers.
* First make it work and then make it better.

If you want to work with us, [see tips for working together](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/760) and [unanswered discussions](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aunanswered+sort%3Adate_created).

## Good to know

The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language. Don't force anything. You can step out of discussions at any time if they are not constructive. Move on if you find yourself in a situation where you have nothing to contribute or learn. Focus on the people who show interest and want to work together with you. Give good ideas a thumbs up. Thank people who helped you. These are only small gestures, but they make working together much more enjoyable.
