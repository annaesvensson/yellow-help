Learn how to ask questions, report bugs and work with us.

## How to ask a question

* Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see.
* Describe as precisely as possible what you want to do and which problems you have.
* Add an example, for example Markdown, settings or your source code.
* Select an answer, when your question has been answered.

If you want to ask a question, [start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/ask-a-question).

## How to report a bug

* Explain how to reproduce the bug, with as many information as you have.
* Show the error message, it's best to copy what you see on your screen.
* Add many details, especially the log file `system/extensions/yellow-website.log`.
* Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed.

If you want to report a bug, [start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/report-a-bug).

## Good to know

We are interested in what you want to do and which problems you have. The more we know, the better. Our community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use an online translator if English is not your first language. Don't force anything. You can step out of discussions at any time if the dialog is not constructive. Focus on the people who show interest and want to work together with you. Thank people who point you in the right direction and who write helpful answers. Give good ideas a thumbs up. This may only be small gestures, but they create inspiration and joy at work. You can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/datenstrom) or [contact a human](https://datenstrom.se/contact/).
