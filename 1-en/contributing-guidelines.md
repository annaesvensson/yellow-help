Learn how to ask questions, report bugs and work with us.

## How to ask a question

* Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see.
* Describe as precisely as possible what you want to do and which problems you have.
* Add an example, for example Markdown, settings, images or your source code.
* Select an answer, when your question has been answered.

If you want to ask a question, [start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/ask-a-question).

## How to report a bug

* Explain how to reproduce the bug, with as many information as you have.
* Show the error message, it's best to copy what you see on your screen.
* Add many details, especially the log file `system/extensions/yellow-website.log`.
* Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed.

## How to work with us

* Think about what you want to do and what would make life easier.
* Ask yourself, do I need this, do I want this, can I make this better?
* First make it work and then make it better.
* You can do it, it's easier than you think.

## Good to know

We are interested in what you want to do and which problems you have. The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language. Don't force anything. You can step out of discussions at any time if they are not constructive. Move on if you find yourself in a situation where you have nothing to contribute or learn. Focus on the people who show interest and want to work together with you. Thank others for their help. These are only small gestures, but they make working together more enjoyable.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/datenstrom-yellow) and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/explore/repos?q=datenstrom-yellow&topic=1), pull requests and improvements are welcome.
