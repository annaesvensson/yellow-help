## Good to know

The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language. Don't force anything. You can step out of discussions at any time if they are not constructive. Move on if you find yourself in a situation where you have nothing to contribute or learn. Focus on the people who show interest and want to work together with you. Say thank you, give a thumbs up, show kindness. These are only three small gestures, but they make working together with people more enjoyable.
