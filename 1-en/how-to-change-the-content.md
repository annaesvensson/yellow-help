Title: How to change the content 
---
All content files are located in the `content` folder. You can edit your website here.

``` box-drawing {aria-hidden=true}
├── content
│   ├── 1-home
│   ├── 9-about
│   └── shared
├── media
└── system
```

The `content` folder is available on your website. Every folder has a file called `page.md`. You can add more files and folders. You can also use special characters in file and folder names, for example ÄÖÅ. In other words, what you see in the file manager is the website you get.

## Files and folders

Your website is automatically created from your `content` folder:

1. Folders can have a numerical prefix for sorting, e.g. `1-home` or `9-about`
2. Files can have a numerical prefix for sorting, e.g. `2020-04-07-blog-example.md`
3. Files and folders without a prefix have no special meaning, e.g. `wiki-example.md`

Prefix and suffix are removed from the location, so that it looks better. For example the folder `content/1-home` is available on your website as `http://website/`. The folder `content/9-about` is available on your website as `http://website/about/`. The file `content/2-wiki/wiki-example.md` is available on your website as `http://website/wiki/wiki-example`. 

While most folders are available on your website, there are two exception. The `content/1-home` folder must not contain subfolders. The `content/shared` folder may only be included in other folders, it's not directly available on your website. 

## Text

You can edit your website in a web browser or text editor. At the top of a page you can change `Title` and other [page settings](how-to-change-the-system#page-settings). Below you can change text and images. Text formatting with [Markdown](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/markdown) is supported. You can also use HTML and shortcuts. Here are some examples:
