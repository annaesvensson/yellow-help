## How to install the help

[Download ZIP file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-help/archive/main.zip) and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update).

## How to use the help

The help is available on your website as `http://website/help/`. The help shows you how to make small websites, wikis and blogs. Here you can find instructions on how to customise everything. For developers, designers and translators there are descriptions of concepts, tools and what can be done with the API. It's recommended to install the [highlight extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-highlight), [search extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-search), [toc extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-toc) together with the help extension. Then you will have the same package as the [help on the official website](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/). 

## How to improve the help

You can improve the help if something is wrong. Install the help on your website, then you can make some changes and review the help from the perspective of the user. If you want to edit the help in a [web browser](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-edit), you can do this on your website at `http://website/edit/help/`. If you want to edit the help on your [computer](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core), have a look inside your `content/9-help` folder. Did you improve the help? Fork this repository.
