## How to use the help

The help is available on your website as `http://website/help/`. The help gives you more information about how to create small websites, wikis and blogs. Here you can find instructions on how to customise everything. Developers and designers can find descriptions of overarching concepts and what can be done with the API. It's recommended to install the [highlight extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-highlight), [search extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-search), [toc extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-toc) together with the help extension. Then you will have the same package as the [help on the official website](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/). 

## How to edit the help

If you want to edit the help in a [web browser](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-edit), you can do this on your website at `http://website/edit/help/`. If you want to edit the help on your [computer](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core), have a look inside your `content/9-help` folder. Here are some tips. Look at the help from the user's perspective. Check that it is helpful to the user and give practical examples. Upload your changes to GitHub, let us know if you need help.
